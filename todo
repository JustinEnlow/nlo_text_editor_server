[x] set up client-server as document viewer with no scrolling or view size changes
[x] set up client-server as document viewer with changeable view size
[x] set up client-server as document viewer with scrolling detached from cursor position
[x] set up client-server as document viewer with scrolling attached to cursor position
    [x] move cursor right
    [x] move cursor left
    [x] move cursor up
    [x] move cursor down
    [x] restrict cursor to line start/end
    [x] restrict cursor to document start/end
    [x] cursor left at line start moves to previous line end if available
    [x] cursor right at line end moves to next line start if available
    [x] make cursor maintain horizontal position or go to line end when moving up/down

// not in a specific order
[ ] figure out how to handle proper tabs, instead of inserting spaces
[x] set up client-server to handle multiple client connections
[ ] highlighting for syntax/selections
[ ] handle multiple cursors
[x] make Cursor struct containing cursor_head and cursor_achor
[ ] make Vec<Cursor> for holding data for multiple cursor
[ ] cursor to line start vs line text start - allow user to decide whether they are separate or if subsequent presses toggle between the two


[x] fix bug where moving cursor right at edge of screen requires extra keypresses(seems to be resolved when resize triggered. verify dimensions on first UpdateClientViewSize request)
    initial: 
        width: 91, height: 47
    resized:
        width: 89, height: 47

    resolved in client side source code
