a text editor server

getting started:
    clone repo
    navigate to directory
    cargo install --path .

    remove ~/.cargo/bin/nlo_text_editor_server when uninstalling/reinstalling
    or cargo uninstall nlo_text_editor_server


design goals:
    - editor daemon to reduce resource usage
    - buffer tabs/splits should be handled by window manager
